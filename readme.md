# 🚀 AI Research Project: Comparing ChatGPT, Claude, and DeepSeek on Simulation Prompts 🧠💻

#### Hey there! 👋 I’m a BTech student at **Sarvajanik College of Engineering and Technology (SCET)**, pursuing my passion for **Artificial Intelligence and Data Science**. As part of my academic and personal exploration, I’ve been diving deep into the world of AI models like **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, and **DeepSeek** to understand their strengths and limitations. This project is all about comparing these models on three simulation-based prompts. Additionally, I’ve experimented with **Agentic AI** using **Phi Data** and **Groq APIs** to build two practical agents: a **Research Agent** and a **LinkedIn/Twitter Post Generator**. Let’s break it all down and see how these technologies come together! 🎉

# 🛠️ Setup Guide for Beginners
### Setting Up the Environment

Before running any code, you need to set up your environment. Here’s how:

1. Install Python: Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. You can download it from python.org.

2. Install Dependencies: Run the following command to install the required libraries:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set Up .env File: Create a .env file in the Agentic AI folder to store your API keys. Here’s what it should look like:


```
PHI_API_KEY=your_phi_api_key_here
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

```
Phi API: Sign up at Phi Data to get your API key.

Groq API: Sign up at Groq to get your API key. 

Note: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70b is temporarily available for free on Groq, but check their website for updates.

# 🤖 Agentic AI: Research Agent & Post Generator
### 1. Research Agent:
This agent uses Phi Data to fetch the latest AI trends and research papers. It’s perfect for staying updated on cutting-edge AI developments.

### 2. LinkedIn/Twitter Post Generator
This agent generates engaging posts about the latest AI trends using Phi Data and Groq APIs. It’s great for sharing insights on social media.

# 🧪 Comparison of ChatGPT, Claude, and DeepSeek
### Prompt 1: Simulate a Double Pendulum System

### Prompt 2: Simulate Multiple Balls Bouncing and Colliding


### Prompt 3: Create a Fireworks Simulation


# 🎯 Key Takeaways
DeepSeek consistently outperformed ChatGPT and Claude in terms of accuracy, realism, and optimization.

Claude was a close second, offering user-friendly and interactive solutions.

ChatGPT provided functional but less polished implementations.

# 🔮 Future Work
Explore more complex simulations and compare the models further.

Integrate DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70b with more Agentic AI applications.

Experiment with other APIs and datasets to enhance the agents’ capabilities.
