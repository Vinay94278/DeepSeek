# Prompt :- Create a visually stunning fireworks simulation where particles shoot up from the ground, explode into vibrant, colorful patterns, and fade out naturally. The simulation should include realistic physics with gravity affecting the particles, slight randomness in explosion patterns, and smooth color transitions. Implement multiple firework launches at random intervals, each with different colors and explosion styles (e.g., circular, starburst, and cascading effects). The particles should have a fading effect to simulate realistic fireworks. Use Python with Pygame or Matplotlib to animate the scene in real-time.
